# Charity Corner

You can preview the website through the [deployed version](https://charity-corner.vercel.app/). Simply create a new account to get started.

This is a front-end only (with very little back-end logic) website built as a university project. We were asked to create a non-monetary donation application for an NGO that will help both the donors and anyone who is requesting a donation to reach each other.
